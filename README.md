# PokéType
This is a Pokémon battling quick-reference tool.

It was a project for a class, and we had to use things like jQuery and jQueryUI. Someday I'll rewrite this thing.

## Usage
Type the opponent's species in the text field to see the effectiveness of each type on the opponent. (National dex number works too, but frankly, it's less useful. The API call is the same, so whatever) ![](http://i.imgur.com/RGaWfDN.png)

## API
This tool uses [Pokéapi](http://pokeapi.co). Type calculations are done locally due to the API being incomplete
